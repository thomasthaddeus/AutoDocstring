Gathering requirements is a crucial part of the software development process. It helps ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users and stakeholders. Here are some of the key factors that should be considered:

Functional Requirements: This defines the basic system functionality. In other words, what tasks should the software perform? What is its intended functionality?
Non-Functional Requirements: These requirements define the system properties and constraints e.g. reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability, portability, and scalability.
User Requirements: Identify who will be using the software and what each user (or user group) needs from the software. This might involve developing user personas or user stories.
System Requirements: Identify any specific technologies, platforms, or systems the software needs to integrate with or support.
Interface Requirements: If the software needs to interface with other systems, define these interfaces and how they will work.
Performance Requirements: Define any specific performance goals, such as response time, throughput, etc.
Data Requirements: What data will the system handle? How should it be stored, retrieved, and displayed?
Security Requirements: What security measures are needed? How will the system protect data and ensure privacy?
Regulatory Requirements: Are there any legal or industry regulations that the software must comply with?
Quality Assurance Requirements: How will the quality of the software be assured? What testing methods will be used?
Scalability and Maintainability: How will the system grow over time? How will updates and maintenance be handled?
Budget and Timeline: What is the budget for the project? What is the timeline for delivery?
As for the programs that provide documentation of such requirements, here are some tools that are commonly used:

Confluence: A content collaboration tool used to help teams collaborate and share knowledge efficiently.
Jira: A project management tool that provides issue tracking and project tracking for software development teams.
Microsoft Azure DevOps: Offers a set of development tools for software teams including tracking work items and bugs, backlog prioritization, sprint planning, and documentation.
Trello: A Kanban-style list-making application that can be used for tracking the progress of different requirements and tasks.
Microsoft Word/Google Docs: For simpler projects, a well-organized Word or Google Docs document might be all you need.
Visio/Draw.io: These tools are useful for creating diagrams to represent system architectures and workflows.

It's crucial to remember that the tool is less important than the process. Good requirements gathering involves clear communication, collaboration between different stakeholders, and a willingness to revise and update requirements as you learn more about what the software needs to do.
